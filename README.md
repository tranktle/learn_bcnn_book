This is a blog that contains jupyter notebooks that I have been practicing when I read the book [Probabilistic Deep Learning  With Python, Keras and TensorFlow Probability by Oliver DÃ¼rr, Beate Sick, and Elvis Murina](https://www.manning.com/books/probabilistic-deep-learning), the table of content to the book's jupyter notebook files can be found from [here](https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dl_book/).
